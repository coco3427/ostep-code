question 1: both recived the same value weather or not the other had alredy changed its value.

question 2: both parent and child could access the file, but i couldnt get any concurency issues to appear.

question 3: not that  know of, i think without the wait() function it gets left up to the scheduler.

question 4: it looks like the different varients do the same thing with different arguments. i guess the different exec calls just give you more controll over what information you use to run a program.

question 5: wait returns the pid of the child process.If we use wait() in child process then wait() returns -1 becuase there is no child and no wait.

question 6: waitpid() is usefull when you need to wait for a specifi child.

question 7: the child cant output to the console, but the  parent can. no error occurs but the child cant pint to the comand line.

question 8: n/a
